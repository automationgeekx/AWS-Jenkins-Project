# AWS-Jenkins-Project

### Simple CI/CD Project

#### Flask App is on Github. Using webhooks, any time a change is made, a Jenkins pipeline is triggered that builds, tests, and deploys the code to a docker container. 

#### All infrastructure is built using IaC (Ansible and Terraform)

##### Future implentation of Prometheus,Splunk, and other monitoring tools will be done soon
